			<li>
				<p>
					Exercising and Ecstatic dancing in my livingroom (sorry no visuals for
					this ðŸ˜…)
				</p>
				<br />
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>Watching a good movie. Here's are 3 of my top favourites</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>Interstellar</h4>
						<p>
							My favourite sci-fi movie. It's partly about father-daughter
							relationship. That is what mainly touches me. And ofcourse the
							Magic of Hans Zimmer.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Spirited Away</h4>
						<p>
							My favourite anime movie. I like the unique and artful animations
							and the weird world they've created.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Coco</h4>
						<p>
							Pixar at it's absolute best. Always touching and hard not to cry
							watching this Animation. I obviousily love (guitar) music so this
							is a clear winner for me.
